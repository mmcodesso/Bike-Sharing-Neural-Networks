This project I did while I was doing the nanodegree in deep learning. You can download the files em run by yourself.

You can check the post i did for it at my website : https://mauriciocodesso.com/post/bikesharing_neuralnetworks/

This solutions uses only numpy and you can see how to do matrix multiplication and how to apply forward and backward propagation by hand.
